    # frame attribute f_lineno (used in function findsource_file), which is
    # supposed to be the 1-based line number of the next line to be executed
    # in the frame where the decoration occurs. However, when called from
    # within the func2str decorator, f_lineno actually is sometimes the line
    # number of the decorator, and sometimes the line number of the decorated
    # 'def' line. (Specifically, the latter occurs when the decorated function
    # has no keyword arguments.)

    # may precede the def line, as well as the def line itself, if present in
    # the list 'source', before extracting and processing the body of the
