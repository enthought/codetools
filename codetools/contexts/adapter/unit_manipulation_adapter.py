    """ Bi-directional unit conversion of values.

        This adapter converts values to a different unit system based on their
        name.  There is a name->units mapper for getitem conversions and a
        separate name->units adapter for setitem conversions so that
        read/write can result in different unit conversions.  This is useful
        when, for example, you want a context to preserve its current units
        for all its variables, but something using this context ( a shell or
        plot, or whatever) wants the values in another unit system.

        If units aren't found for a particular name, the converter silently
        lets the variable pass through.  If units are found, but a converter
        isn't, or the converter fails, a ConversionError is raised.  Users
        can pass in a dictionary of converters functions to be used for
        unit conversion.

    """
    #fixme: I can imagine places where we don't want name lookup to silently
    #       pass.  A flag like 'fail_on_name_not_found' or something like
    #       that might be useful.
